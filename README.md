## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

![MechaCarLinearRegression](https://github.com/alosmad/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/9931e76e8ee066b5ab4682ad743ee255a522b270/MechaCarLinearRegression.png)

- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
    (Intercept), vehicle_length & ground_clearance
 - Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
    The slope of our linear model is not zero because the p-value of our linear regression analysis is 5.35e-11 which is much smaller than our assumed significance level     of 0.05%
 - Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
    Roughly 71.49% of all mpg predictions will be correct because the r-squared value is 0.7149
